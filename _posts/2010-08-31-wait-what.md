If you look at the timestamp on the Cloud Hopping post, I believe the date is 5/21 or something like that. It is now 10/31. Five months and ten days later. Since then, I have written a huge amount of code professionally, worked at the local pool, played my trumpet a lot, argued for the fun of it, and juggled the school play and my college classes.

My inaction is either a testimony to the idea that I pick projects that are too hard for me to finish, or that I am wasting too much time at school and should drop out. For the life of me, I can't figure out which one it is.
