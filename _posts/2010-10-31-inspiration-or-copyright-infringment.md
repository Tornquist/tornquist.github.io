I probably shouldn't be blogging. I am far too busy and my thoughts are not worth publishing, but I am fascinated with the idea that anyone can share their thoughts, regardless of it they have earned that right. Today's topic related back to programming, but also deals with the concept of intellectual property.

I am a sporadic programmer. I dabble here and there, developing a project and then moving on to a new language. The longest I have spent on a language was directly related to my employment as a C# programmer. Being paid to program tends to encourage it.

When I code, I tend to work on the most grandiose projects. I never think of any simple or nice little ideas. The gameplay for my video game concepts is straightforward, but as I've said, the engines are demanding. Because of this, I find it easier to clone the work of others, improving their concept as I see fit.

The movie The Social Network isn't really about Facebook. It's about sex, which ultimately means it's about life. The film tells the story of inspiration and debates the concept of who owns it. In life, ownership of an idea is more valuable that anything else. So, when I take a classic game that I love and remake it, do I have the right to distribute it?

I would write my own code, and make my own art, but the base concept came from someone else. Legally, that right is mine. I would essentially be making a knockoff, but if sold under a new name with no false promises, it's all good.

My qualm is with the moral implications. I hate the idea of copying people. It takes away a lot of the success to think that all you did was rewrite something that someone else had written before. While I'm cool with copying stories and ideas from classic literature to make a game. I'm bothered by the concept of producing "The Sword of Shannara" as "The Walking Stick of Shannara."

I do not know the answer to this problem. I want to code, and I want to make games that feel like the ones that I love, but how do I do that without presenting a piece that is nothing more that a bit if this and a bite or two of that.

Well, my thought have been presented to the two or three of you that actually read this. I have stated my mind, succeeded in arrogantly sharing myself, and now have grown tired of my own voice. With that, I conclude.
