I have actively started working on Cloud Hopping, my newest game. I have done a bunch of concept art and will start turning it all into digital art and coding everything shortly. I plan on uploading concept art in a few days. I would have it now, but I don't want to hook up the scanner right now. Instead of explaining the purpose and meaning behind the game, as that would give it all away, I will simply list the things that inspired this idea/project. The entire game is based on novels that I have read. The main influences of work are as follows:

- Brave New World - *Aldous Huxley*
- Deeper - *Jeff Long*
- The Hunger Games - *Suzanne Collins*
- The Road - *Cormac McCarthy*

Numerous other works and concepts have been pulled into this game concept, but the above novels provide the main scenes/levels in the game.
