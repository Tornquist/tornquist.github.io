I recently got a MSP430 (Microcontroller) and have started playing with it.  The device is essentially Texas Instrument's version of the Arduino.  Unfortunately there is no easy way to connect the dev kit to a breadboard for quick prototyping and testing.  To solve this I had to make my own cables.  Following is a demo video of the cable setup and a simple app to test the connections to the board:
