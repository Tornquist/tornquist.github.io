Over Christmas break I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to work a bit around all of the design that I need to do for Yearbook.  I added a full image sending system to Messenger, the program that I worked on and expanded over the summer.  You can now load images, or take screenshots that will be sent through the database.  Everything is encoded and stored as text and loaded when a specially formatted hyperlink is clicked. This means that image sending has a relatively small footprint, and adds a necessary function to the Lightyear Communication system. I pleased with how it all turned out and really enjoyed coding a little project again.  Below is what the basic interface looks like.
