(To my one reader who probably already knows this.)

I live under the belief that I am a funny person, and try to make this true by telling my friends it quite regularly.  You know, the whole "you can make yourself into the person you want to be" thing.  So, who knows, I may be funny, I may be full of it.  Eitherway, I've added (am adding) a Twitter feed to this blog.  I don't write a ton, and most of my thoughts can be summarized in 160 characters or so. (That sounds awful.) With the amount of graphic design yearbook requires and with all my freeish time being put towards my professional work as opposed to hobbyist iPhone development, I don't have too much to blog about anyway.  Although, I did decide that the best way to protect yourself against piracy was entrapment of users through illegal data collection and viable software that doubles as spyware.

That's all for now.
