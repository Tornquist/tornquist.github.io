Due to some trademark issues with the word "Pong" Google removed Solo Pong from the Google Play Market. I have renamed the application and re-released it. I have updated the links on my portfolio and throughout this website. The new title is Solo Defense, which hopefully doesn't violate any laws.

I learned some interesting things about the word pong. It seems to only be illegal to use pong when it is a standalone title, or a title with an adjective. Games like Ping Pong and Beer Pong, the other major pong games on the Android market seem to be just fine.

Anyway, it's back online. Those few of you that downloaded the game before would need to download the new application. I changed the package name, so it will not auto update.
