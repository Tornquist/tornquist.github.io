I have attempted to optimize this website so that it loads faster and in turn handles better.  Unfortunately, my hosting is on a Windows-based GoDaddy server, and I cannot change that to Linux, so I cannot set individual file permissions.  In the end, caching is not possible so I had to make due with other small optimizations.  I apologize for any inconvenience.

As a side note, as much as it pains me to write this as a faithful Firefox user, my website loads faster in Chrome.
