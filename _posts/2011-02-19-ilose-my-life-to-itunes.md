So, I'm running iOS 4.0.  It is jailbroken, and I have a fair number of programs installed that run in the background.  This means that the battery life is awful and the device crashes more than I would like. I have to have a jailbroken iPod so that I can use AppSync and continue to develop.  At this point I am coding without a Developer License because I haven't learned Objective-C enough to make a decent product. My brother suggests that I upgrade to iOS 4.2.1, thinking that it'll clear out my background apps and speed up the device in general.

I spent 6-ish hours yesterday trying to get the upgrade and jailbreak to work correctly.  Upgrading iTunes both on Windows and Mac.  Eventually, problems with 4.2.1 caused me to downgrade back to 4.0 and cost another 4 hours of my time.

In the end, I believe that I can code correctly and I have my iPod tethered correctly with PDANet again.  What did I gain though? I sped up my iPod slightly and fixed the broken clock.  The time keeping functions were broken and I have had the timezone set to a strange little island in the middle of the ocean. In the end, I spent roughly 10 hours that I could have been coding trying to fix a device that I messed up. I was very surprised with the quality of Apple's device restore though.  All my icons retained their location, and all the application settings are the same. I feel a little silly, but it was certainly a learning experience.
