This is a quick port of the solo pong game that I built for the Microsoft Zune. This game does not have a scoring system or a menu yet, as it is an early build, but the game aspect is functional. Press **space to start the game**, and see how long you can keep the block on the screen using the **arrow keys to move the paddles**.

Note: Make sure you click inside the flash window to give it focus before you start the game.

<script type="text/javascript">
$(function() {
  swfobject.embedSWF("/assets/2010/03/solo_pong.swf", "soloPong", "400", "300", "9.0.0");
});
</script>

<div id="soloPong">
  <p>
    <a href="/assets/2010/03/solo_pong.swf">Solo Pong</a>
    <em>(Embedded Flash file did not load correctly. Link is to the
    *.swf file)</em>
  </p>
</div>
