This is a quick port of the solo pong game that I built for the Microsoft Zune. This game does not have a scoring system or a menu yet, as it is an early build, but the game aspect is functional. Press **space to start the game**, and see how long you can keep the block on the screen using the **arrow keys to move the paddles**.

Note: Make sure you click inside the flash window to give it focus before you start the game.
