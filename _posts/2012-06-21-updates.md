As you may have noticed, this website is quite different looking.  Through some updates to my Dad's site a lot of my old system got messed up.  Instead of patching it back together again, we decided to move to Linux servers so WordPress would actually run correctly, and I started from scratch with a fresh install.  Much of the old information is here, I've removed some plugins that were rarely used, so old flash and silverlight apps I've posted will not work, but the rest should function just fine.  You should also notice a huge improvement in speed.  Enjoy!
