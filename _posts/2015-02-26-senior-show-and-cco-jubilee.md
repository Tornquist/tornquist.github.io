It's been awhile since I've written a blog post. If you haven't noticed, the entire website has been redesigned with the main page no longer being my blog. This past August I rebuilt the entire site in rails and have since had a few other rails projects bouncing around. My activity on GitHub has significantly increased if you want to check out any of my [work](https://github.com/Tornquist/).

During the fall semester I designed a few processors: single cycle, pipeline, pipeline with caches, and finally a multicore processor. In addition, I built a compiler for a language designed by one of my processors.  All of that work is for class though, and is closed source.  I'll write more extensively about the [Online Toolbox](https://github.com/Tornquist/onlinetoolbox) when it is finished, but until then I have a few other neat updates.

As a senior member of the Purdue All-American Marching Band, I had the opportunity to help design the senior show. You can see the product of our work here below.  I had the exciting opportunity to be in charge of that project and designed both of the two opening two songs with TJ Root, and set up the train at the end.

In addition to that, I was selected as a finalist in a project lead by the [High Calling](http://www.thehighcalling.org/).  The idea was to write a short testimony about your views on faith and work. You can see my video below.
