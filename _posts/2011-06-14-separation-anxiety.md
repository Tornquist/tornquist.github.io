Yesterday a sad thing happened; the death of my friend.  The motherboard on my first laptop finally gave out, and in desperation I tried to repair it. What happened was four years of excessive use.  Over time the graphics chip slowly separated from the main motherboard.  Really, it's amazing that the computer lasted so long, but I'm still bummed that it broke.  I do not like it at all when my things things break.  So, I took it apart and tried to melt the solder enough to reattach the graphics chip to the motherboard.  Sadly, it did not work.  I also tried to get it to melt together by overheating, although I gave in to that too soon because I didn't want to burn anything else.  I'll probably try to fix it again later, but for now, it's down for the count.
