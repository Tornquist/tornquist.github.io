Yesterday a sad thing happened; the death of my friend. The motherboard on my
first laptop finally gave out, and I tried to repair it. After four years of
excessive use, the graphics chip slowly separated from the main motherboard.

Really, it's amazing that the computer lasted so long, but I'm still bummed that
it broke. I do not like it at all when my things things break. So, I took it
apart and tried to melt the solder enough to reattach the graphics chip to the
motherboard. Sadly, it did not work. I also tried to get it to melt together by
overheating, although I gave in to that too soon because I didn't want to burn
anything else. I'll probably try to fix it again later, but for now, it's down
for the count.
