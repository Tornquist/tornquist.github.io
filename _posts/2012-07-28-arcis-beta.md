***Beta Closed.  Any further registrations will simply result in a notification email when the game is released.***

Arcis is nearing completion.  I hope to start the beta period next week.  If you are interested in participating in the public beta, please fill out the form below.

Arcis is a tower-defense game crossed with an arcade game.  You can build towers and design your own defense system like a standard tower-defense game, but you also have the ability to control an upgradeable main tower.  The innovative cross between a classic arcade feel and the strategy aspects of a tower-defense game is what sets this game apart.
