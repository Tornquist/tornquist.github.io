A few weeks ago I wrote a post about wasting an entire weekend restoring my iPod trying to update it to the new OS. I claimed that the only thing I gained was fixing the clock feature. Well, it's broken again. I have spent hours researching it before, and am just going to throw in the towel about it this time. There have been time issues since iOS 1.2.x and I have no idea why Apple doesn't address the problem. On a damaged device the user is able to set the time and have it stick until a location based app is run. Meaning that I can use my iPod normally until Facebook starts, then the time rolls back about 5 hours. The end of this story is simple. I live in northern Iowa and have yet again set my time zone to Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. Life is simpler when you live abroad.
