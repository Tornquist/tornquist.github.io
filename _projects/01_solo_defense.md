Solo Defense was the first game that I put on Google Play, and the first game that I make in
every new language that I learn. This game normally acts as a quick 1-day project I use to
teach myself basic language features. While the game on Google Play is out of date and doesn't
play well on modern Android devices, it still has a respectable userbase and is an important
part of my "Android Story."

The game is simple.  Like Atari's PONG, the goal is to keep the ball in
play.  In my version however, you control all four sides.  The game
starts with the top and sides completely filled in, and lets you move
the bottom paddle to keep the ball in play.  As the game progresses, the
walls shrink and you have to manage all four sides to keep the ball in
play. Furthermore, you learn that moving one paddle will also move the
opposite paddle in the other direction.  This game is fun, but gets
difficult very quickly.
