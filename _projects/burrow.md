Burrow is the product of a 24-hour race to build a "Flappy-Bird"-like game. This project included a
redesign of the libraries that I developed during the creation of Arcis. My focus with this project
was not only to create a game quickly, but to create a game that could be quickly picked up and put
down, unlike my other games that are a little bit more demanding and have a rather steep learning curve.

What to play the game? [Grab it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.petronicarts.burrow)

Curious how I built it? [Look through the code](https://github.com/Tornquist/Burrow)
