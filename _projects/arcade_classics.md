During the early days of the Zune I built a colletion of Arcade Games
using .NET and XNA.  This is the first set of games I ever released to
the public. It was a pretty exciting time.

To actually run the games, every user would have to manually install
Visual Studio Express and download the XNA libraries.  Even with those
limitations, I still had 1000's of people download and play my games.
