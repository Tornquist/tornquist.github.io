Solo Defense was the first game that I put on Google Play, and the first game that I make in
every new language that I learn. This game normally acts as a quick 1-day project I use to
teach myself basic app structure. While the game on Google Play is out of date and doesn't
play well on modern Android devices, it still has a respectable userbase and is an important
part of my "Android Story."

What to play the game? [Grab it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.petronicarts.solodefense)

Curious how I built it? [Look through the code](https://github.com/Tornquist/Solo_Defense)
