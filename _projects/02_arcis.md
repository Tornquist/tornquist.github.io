Arcis was my first large-scale Android project and the first that had any semblance of an artifical intelligence
system. I reverse engineered A\* pathfinding to improve performance and allow all of the enemy
units to navigate together. Testing was done through major Reddit croudsourcing and I received
incredibly valuable feedback for the creation of the final product.

This game is best described as a mix between tower defence and arcade.
You can shoot enemies by controlling the main tower, or build defenses
that will attack enemies for you.  Some strategies work better than
others, but ultimately it is up to you.
