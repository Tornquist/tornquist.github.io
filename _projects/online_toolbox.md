For a marching band to function well it needs numbers.  You need a large
number of people interested in auditioning so that you can select people
that are able to play their instruments at a high performing level and
march at the same time.  Additionally, you need a large number of people
in the band so that you can actually make interesting shapes on the
field.

Purdue does not have a music school, so the recruitment of people that
fill that category falls into the hands of the students interested in
being part of marching band. As a member of the marching band for four
years I was deeply involved in the band and its success.  As a sort of
graduation gift, I rebuilt a dated recruiting system into a full Rails
application.  This new tool allows for detailed tracking, scheduling and
reporting both before and during each season.

The main goal was to make the recruiting process both easier, and more
transparent.  During the first season it was used, the trumpet section
alone had ~20% more students in camp than the historical average.
