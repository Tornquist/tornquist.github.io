Arcis was my first large-scale Android project and the first that had any semblance of an artifical intelligence
system. I reverse engineered A\* pathfinding to improve performance and allow all of the enemy
units to navigate together. Testing was done through major Reddit croudsourcing and I received
incredibly valuable feedback for the creation of the final product.

What to play the game? [Grab it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.petronicarts.arcis)

Curious how I built it? [Look through the code](https://github.com/Tornquist/Arcis)
