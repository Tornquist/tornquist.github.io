I really enjoyed [analyzing my working hours in 2017][1], and I'm a
big fan of the infographics that [Nicholas Felton][2] makes on his own life.

The goal of this project is to combine those two ideas into a platform for
continuous monitoring and reporting on how I spend my time. Past the basics of
time tracking, I want a multi-user system that can track individual events
(timestamps) as well as time ranges (start to finish).

That's what I've been building. *Time* as I've been calling the project is
powered by a core server to hold the data as well as series of iOS and MacOS
client applications. I am designing Time to meet the particular needs and curiosity
that I have.

The project currently consists of the following repositories:

* [Time-Client][3]
* [Time-API][4]
* [Time-Core][5]

I have written about this project in these posts:

* [Time Tracking][6]
* [Is my timer running?][7]
* [Building a Realtime Widget][8]
* [SwiftUI as a Design Tool][9]
