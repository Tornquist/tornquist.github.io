Burrow was created as a response to Flappy-Bird. It had been almost 2 years
since the release of [Arcis][1] and I wanted to challenge myself to build a
game quickly, and to build a quick game.

I took the libraries that had been developed for Arcis and simplified and rewrote
them for this project. Using that as a foundation I set out to build this game
in 24-hours.

The mechanic is simple. The player controls a bunny and tries to avoid being
eaten by the hawks. The bunny must eat carrots to gain health, and can ***Burrow***
to avoid being eaten. As the game progresses clouds come in and it becomes harder
to see the birds and predict their attacks.

[Michael Betz][2] did the sound effects for this game (I believe he recorded them
on a gameboy) and it can be downloaded from [Google Play][3]. I also have the
source code on [GitHub][4] and a longer [blog post][5] about the game.
