When building a social media program for athletics, good and consistent graphics
are an extremely powerful tool. Whether it is a picture of a play that just occurred,
or a summary of pre/post game festivities, the visual aspect matters a lot.

My brother is a professional motion video designer in college athletics. He designs
the social media campaigns and final graphics for use during and around games.

While he may be the only individual designing a particular graphic, the entire
program is facilitated by multiple people in the design team and on the field.
It's a large team, and a luxury that not every organization will have. High schools,
smaller colleges, and even less popular sports at D1 schools may not (and probably)
will not have access to resources like that.

> That's where Uplink comes in.

Uplink is designed to bridge that gap. Together we designed and built this product
to fill that need.

Uplink is designed to be a **fast** and **easy** tool that allows social graphics to
be created from a smart phone on the field. Our templates are designed for particular
sports and allow for photos and logos to be added to a writeup of the final score or play
and shared directly on Twitter, Facebook, etc.
