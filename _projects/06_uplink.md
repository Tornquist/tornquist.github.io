When building a social media program good and consistent media is an extremely
powerful tool. For athletics this media must also be created quickly. It is
important that posts about plays occur immediately after the play; any delay
significantly reduces the effectiveness and impact of whatever was shared.

[My brother][1] designs and leads athletic social media programs and was working
at Purdue while we were building Uplink together. The concept was simple, we wanted
to build a tool that would allow small athletic programs to create and build
social media programs like the larger programs with dedicated staff.

At Purdue, he sat in the pressbox and would receive feeds of photos from photographers
on the field. These images would be fed into templates he had designed during
the week and would then be sent out for sharing on Twitter and Instagram. The
work Matt was doing with his team created high quality social media graphics.

Not every program has the resources to do that, and even at universities with
resources, the smaller sports rarely receive the same treatment as football and
basketball.

**That is where Uplink comes in.** Together we created a program that would allow
individuals to take photos on the field and immediately create and share
graphics built around those photos. Uplink ships with a set of templates for
Baseball, Basketball, Football, Soccer, Softball and Volleyball, and all of the
processing is done on the device.

{% include photos.html

  img4="/assets/images/projects/uplink/03_edit.png"
  img5="/assets/images/projects/uplink/04_gallery.png"
%}

School colors and fonts could be shared in Uplink and the templates could be
modified quickly to fit the needs of the program.

Uplink is live on the [App Store][2] and is still actively used today. Years after
its release, we still have a large group of active users, around 80/month, with
large spikes annually during March Madness. These users are building and releasing
graphics that reach a much wider group of people in their respective communities.

Uplink was designed for and met the goal of providing resources to smaller
schools and programs. One of my favorite photos is of an Uplink graphic
used as a jumbotron background at a high school. That is the need Matt and I
set out to fill.
