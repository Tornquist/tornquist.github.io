title: Enova International
description: >
  Enova is a fintech loan company. Historically their products are all web-based.
  Lots of front-end web frameworks. As a member of the mobile team, I was
  responsible for working on the design and deployment of native applications
  and infrastructures. Everything from Go to native Swift was fair game. Our main
  objective was to build a software factory and develop scaleable systems so that
  a small team could support a multitude of different products.
