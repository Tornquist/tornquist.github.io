description: >
  As a member of the mobile team, I was responsible for working on the
  design and deployment of native applications and infrastructures.
  Everything from Go to native Swift was fair game. Our main objective
  was to build a software factory and develop scaleable systems so that
  a small team could support a multitude of different products.
