description: >
  Enova is a fintech loan company. Their public products are an offering of
  high-risk loans, while their internal products are decision engines to offer/not-offer
  those loans. As a rails developer I helped automate the management of customer reports,
  loan processing, and billing. I also worked on a visualization tool for SQL
  queries and automated re-billing of customers.
