title: Purdue Engineering Education
description: >
  I worked on a small research/dev team that built survey tools for engineering
  education experiments and evaluations of new methods. Freshman Engineering at Purdue
  was a very carefully designed program (experiment), and was the focus of the faculty member's
  research. In addition to the survey tools and platform, I redesigned a site that
  provided vital information to advisers and integrated with an Android-based
  queuing system. The platform was built in HTML5, Python, and DTML.
