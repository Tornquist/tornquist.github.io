title: Purdue University
description: >
  I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering. Computer Engineering at
  Purdue is more of a hardware engineering degree than a software engineering
  degree. That was an intentional decision, as it allowed me to learn and really
  explore the technology that I would be using daily as I wrote software.
