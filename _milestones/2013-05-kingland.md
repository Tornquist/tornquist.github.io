description: >
  Kingland is a financial company that builds financial software to track conflict's
  of interest between financial advisors and assets they can or cannot work with.
  I joined Kingland as a software engineer, but the company needs pulled me into more of
  a DBA/DevOps type of role. I led the research efforts into ETL technologies
  using IBM DataSphere and developed an extensive set of templates, scripts, and
  documentation for those tools.
