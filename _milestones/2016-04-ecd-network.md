title: ECD Network (now SkinIO)
description: >
  I joined ECD-Network as the first non-contract/full-time iOS engineer. My role was
  to take the existing iOS prototype and rebuild it for sustainability and scaleability.
  I ended up redesigning the application from the ground up. The redesign work
  expanded into a full server redesign and then a full redesign of the entire
  technology stack as I took over as lead engineer and then CTO (see SkinIO).
