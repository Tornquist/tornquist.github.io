description: >
  SkinIO is a company that builds early cancer detection software for dermatology.
  Using computer vision and machine learning, the software maps moles and allows
  them to be tracked over time. I am the lead engineer and am responsible for architecting
  and leading the development of this technology. My time is split between server development,
  DevOps work, and development of the iOS App.
