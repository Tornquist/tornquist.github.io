I am the CTO for [SkinIO](https://SkinIO.com/).

I recently built [Uplink Sports](https://uplinkapp.com) with my
[brother](https://twitter.com/matttornquist). It is no longer being actively
developed, but I still actively maintain it.

I graduated from [Purdue](http://www.purdue.edu) with a degree in Computer
Engineering in May of 2015. While at Purdue I was a dedicated member of the
[marching band](http://www.purdue.edu/bands) and I still love to play my trumpet
whenever the opportunity arises.
