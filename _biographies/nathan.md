I am the lead engineer for [SkinIO](https://SkinIO.com/) during by day, and the cofunder of [Uplink](http://uplinkapp.com) by night.

I graduated from [Purdue](http://www.purdue.edu) with a degree in Computer Engineering in May of 2015. While at Purdue I was a dedicated member of the [marching band](http://www.purdue.edu/bands) and I still love to play my trumpet whenever the opportunity arises.
