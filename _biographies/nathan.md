I graduated from [Purdue](http://www.purdue.edu) with a degree in
Computer Engineering in May of 2015. While at Purdue I was a dedicated member of the
[marching band](http://www.purdue.edu/bands) and still play my trumpet
in Chicago as a member of the [City Wide Symphony
Orchestra](http://www.citywideorchestra.org/).

I am currently working as a software developer for [Enova
International](http://www.enova.com).  At Enova I am a member of the
mobile team, and spend my days designing everything from native
applications (iOS and Android) to the servers that power them (Go).
