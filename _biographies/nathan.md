Hello,

My name is Nathan Tornquist.

I graduated from [Purdue](http://www.purdue.edu) with a degree in
Computer Engineering. While at Purdue I was a dedicated member of the
[marching band](http://www.purdue.edu/bands) and still play my trumpet
in Chicago as a member of the [City Wide Symphony
Orchestra](http://www.citywideorchestra.org/).

I am currently working as a software developer for [Enova
International](http://www.enova.com).  At Enova I am a member of the
mobile team, and spend my days designing everything from native
applications (iOS and Android) to the servers that power them (Go).

While you're here, you should check out my
[projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/)
or read some of the articles that I've written on my
[blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/).

Thanks for visiting!

Nathan
